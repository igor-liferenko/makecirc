This serves as example of circuit drawings and to demonstrate trick how to speed up TEX processing when a lot of files are used.

simply change "input TEX" to "input latex" temporarily while drawing and use two "mp" calls - it will be faster

NOTE: this whole mess with TEX can be avoided in "makecirc" completely if we use btex/etex directly in "transistor" call (and others).
